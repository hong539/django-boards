#### Django Boards

- The Django Boards project is a discussion board (a forum).

- The whole idea is to maintain several boards, which will behave like categories.

- Then, inside a specific board, a user can start a new discussion by creating a new topic.

- In this topic, other users can engage in the discussion posting replies.

- Feel free to check it out, create new boards, topics, and reply to existing posts. The project is available [here](https://django-boards-unchained.herokuapp.com/).
