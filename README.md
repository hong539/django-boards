## General Information
- Django Boards is a discussion board (a forum).
- The whole idea is to maintain several boards, which will behave like categories.
- Then, inside a specific board, a user can start a new discussion by creating a new topic.
- In a given topic, other users can engage in the discussion by posting replies.
- I undertook this project as a means of learning the Django Web Framework.

- Feel free to check it out, create new boards, topics, and reply to existing posts. The project is available [here](https://django-boards-unchained.herokuapp.com/).
